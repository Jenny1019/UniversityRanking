  With the expansion and greater popularity of higher education, rankings of higher education institutions started to attract more and more peopleâ€™s attention all over the world. Many higher-school graduates and their families consider university ranking as one of important indicators for university quality and therefore make their decision in the selection of universities mostly based on university ranking. On the other side, ranking for higher education is an important way to encourage different institutions to keep improving academic quality as well as industry reputation. Multiple ranking systems have been designed by a variety of institutions of different countries, which includes social media, academics and government organizations. Not limited by assigning numbers to the whole education institution worldwide, ranking systems could also perform ranks to specific schools and programs and for specific countries. 
  This paper will focus on medical school in the United States and explore discrepancies and similarities of several popular ranking systems. Then a stepwise statistical approach would be applied to detect the most contributing factors to medical school ranking using a sample dataset from U.S. News & World Report. This approach is trying to find a decent linear regression function for medical school ranking so as to provide more insightful and effective solutions for university medical school strategic planning.
